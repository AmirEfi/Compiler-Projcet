# Compiler-Project
## Final Project of Compiler course - Spring 2023
It's a sample of the LLVM project for parsing two kinds of sentences:
1. 'type int a, b, c;'
2. 'c = a + (c - (b*c));'
   
***Note: these files are not written completely based on the above explanation and most of the parts are just a simple calculator based on this [rep](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-LLVM-12/tree/master/Chapter03/calc/src).***
